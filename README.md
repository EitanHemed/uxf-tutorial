# Unity Experiment Framework tutorial

This tutorial will walk you through building a simple virtual reality experiment using UXF. Crucially, it will not be a general Unity tutorial (there are thousands already available!) but it will focus on how to make best use of UXF features. Here we will be creating a virtual reality visuomotor-rotation experiment. In these experiments, the user must reach towards an object under a rotated coordinate system until they adapted to the manipulation. Then, the visuomotor-rotation is removed, and the user must de-adapt to the manipulation.

The tutorial will begin by creating a simple keyboard/mouse version of the experiment. Then we will introduce UXF and begin collecting data and manipulating the task. Finally, we will make a few changes to make the project compatible with VR headsets.
