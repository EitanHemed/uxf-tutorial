# Using GitHub with this tutorial

You can use GitHub to download the project files at different stages of the tutorial, as well as the finished project.

1. Go here: [https://github.com/immersivecognition/uxf-tutorial-project/commits/master](https://github.com/immersivecognition/uxf-tutorial-project/commits/master) and find the part you wish to view.
2. Press the `<>` icon to browse the code at this point.
3. Search through the `Assets` folder to view the code at this point in time, or press `Clone or download` to pull the project files down to your PC.

You can also click the commit ID (the 7 digit code) to view the changes introduced at this stage. (Only pay attention to changes to `.cs` and `.json` files - the others are Unity's files which shouldn't be edited by hand.) [Here's an example of a change when we added a miss outcome](https://github.com/immersivecognition/uxf-tutorial-project/commit/fc676892bbc98d5f40ac0f9ef17ab7c4079ea243#diff-6745d3941a6f5d4b9d0a4824b30197b3).   

The project uses Unity 2019.2.1f - To ensure compatibility use a version 2019.2.X from Unity Hub.
